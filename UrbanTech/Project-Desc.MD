## Disease / outbreak detection based on natural language processing

- Idea: * (in preparation of the thesis) Could you detect, based on e.g. social media, that there is an suspiciuous amount of sick notes to be expected?
        * Can it be pinned to a certain region?
        * Where is the connection to actual existing data, e.g. from the CDC
        * Outbreak detection even before it has been reported by the officials?
- Model: * ???
- Software: * Python (NLTK?)
- Twitter Dev API: https://developer.twitter.com/
- Data: * https://www.cdc.gov/ (USA)
        * https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/gesundheitsberichterstattung-berlin-kontext-gesundheitsmonitoring-2018 (Berlin)
        * Twitter
        * https://www.bigcitieshealth.org (Big Cities Health Coalition)
