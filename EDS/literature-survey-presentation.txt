# (0) inspirational quote by Richard Feynmann: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool."
# (1) Create a common-sense baseline first
- https://towardsdatascience.com/first-create-a-common-sense-baseline-e66dbf8a8a47
- that would be the most basic approach, given the fact, that you (should) know your data and the problem at hand
- other than that any heuristic should do the same for you

# (2) Go for a simple (stupid) model, which serves as your first benchmark

# (3) Use already existing baseline models/data sets for comparison

# Remarks for the presentation
- a basis for comparison of results, a meaningful reference point
- when starting collecting results from different algorithms a baseline can support in deciding whether they are adding value
- then you might want to redefine your data set, features, hyperparameters et cetera
- check why your advanced model fails (look at the baseline)
- consider if implementing a more complex model is worth the effort in the long-term
- Google's ML rules: "Some teams aim for a "neutral" first launch: a first launch that explicitly de­prioritizes machine learning gains, to avoid getting distracted"
