# (0) inspirational quote by Richard Feynmann: "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself â€” and you are the easiest person to fool."
# (1) Create a common-sense baseline first

- that would be the most basic approach, given the fact, that you (should) know your data and the problem at hand
- other than that any heuristic should do the same for you

# (2) Go for a simple (stupid) model, which serves as your first benchmark

# (3) Use already existing baseline models/data sets for comparison
